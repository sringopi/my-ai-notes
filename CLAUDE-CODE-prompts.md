## Create EC2 instance

```
create an ec2 instance in us-west-region.  instance type t3 small.  ubuntu.  create a suitable security group which  │
│   allows all traffic from my current ip address.

use the key <<keyname>>.  any subnet is ok.  assign public ip address. finally give me the ssh command    │
│   that I can run from my command line.  test to ensure that you're able to ssh into it.  if it doesn't work, delete    │
│   the instance and recreate it.

###
Implement a web page that looks like [Image #1]. Then screenshot it with Puppeteer and
   iterate till it looks like the image. Think through the ask, plan and then implement.
    check with me if anything is required.


###  Migrating a website 
```
go to www.xyz.com and make a clone of the landing page using modern react framework.

is this a static site or does it use serverside rendering

can you check if the newly created application didn't miss any sections or content 
  from the original website?  Use Puppeteer to compare, if needed.  Think through and 
  plan your validation.  If there are errors in the new application, fix it and re-test.
   Think through and plan  those fixes.

yes, can you please ensure that the website is responsive?

Can you check if the content details in these pages match the source website? I see 
  that location and hours are inaccurate. Also, check if mailing address exists in the 
  source website.  Remove it from the new reactjs app if it is not present in the 
  source.

Can you check the website for other similar inaccuracies or differences with the 
  source website?


I want to keep the content under "About AMC" section in the source website  as-is, 
  verbatim in the target.

I see top menu items with "+" expanding to provide navigation to multiple pages - for 
  example, "About+" and "Registration+".  Can you ensure that these pages and content 
  are implemented.  think about it, plan and implement.
